# abstract: Can we avoid wars at the crossroads of history? This question has been pursued by individuals, scholars, policymakers, and organizations throughout human history. In this research, we attempt to answer the question based on the recent advances of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs). We propose \textbf{WarAgent}, an LLM-powered multi-agent AI system, to simulate the participating countries, their decisions, and the consequences, in historical international conflicts, including the World War I (WWI), the World War II (WWII), and the Warring States Period (WSP) in Ancient China. By evaluating the simulation effectiveness, we examine the advancements and limitations of cutting-edge AI systems' abilities in studying complex collective human behaviors such as international conflicts under diverse settings. In these simulations, the emergent interactions among agents also offer a novel perspective for examining the triggers and conditions that lead to war. Our findings offer data-driven and AI-augmented insights that can redefine how we approach conflict resolution and peacekeeping strategies. The implications stretch beyond historical analysis, offering a blueprint for using AI to understand human history and possibly prevent future international conflicts. Code and data are available at [this url](https://github.com/agiresearch/WarAgent). 

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: In addition to the substance in phonology, a number of researchers have argued that computation also matters in phonology. Using the data in Yavapai (Yuman language), I show that other than an OT analysis focusing mainly on substance, a computational analysis is necessary for explaining the complex syllabification processes and the frequencies of optional surface representations due to different syllabifications. I will use computational complexity encoded in subregular hierarchy as the main technical tool in the computational analysis. Our main hypothesis is that when both SRs are well-formed based on the syllable phonotactics, the one less complex to generate is more frequently attested. The paper shows that the syllabification pattern in Yavapai necessarily requires a computational motivation, which in turn shows that computational property is a crucial factor in phonological transformations.

## Abstract
In addition to the substance in phonology, a number of researchers have argued that computation also matters in phonology. Using the data in Yavapai (Yuman language), I show that other than an OT analysis focusing mainly on substance, a computational analysis is necessary for explaining the complex syllabification processes and the frequencies of optional surface representations due to different syllabifications. I will use computational complexity encoded in subregular hierarchy as the main technical tool in the computational analysis. Our main hypothesis is that when both SRs are well-formed based on the syllable phonotactics, the one less complex to generate is more frequently attested. The paper shows that the syllabification pattern in Yavapai necessarily requires a computational motivation, which in turn shows that computational property is a crucial factor in phonological transformations.
