# abstract: Can we avoid wars at the crossroads of history? This question has been pursued by individuals, scholars, policymakers, and organizations throughout human history. In this research, we attempt to answer the question based on the recent advances of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs). We propose \textbf{WarAgent}, an LLM-powered multi-agent AI system, to simulate the participating countries, their decisions, and the consequences, in historical international conflicts, including the World War I (WWI), the World War II (WWII), and the Warring States Period (WSP) in Ancient China. By evaluating the simulation effectiveness, we examine the advancements and limitations of cutting-edge AI systems' abilities in studying complex collective human behaviors such as international conflicts under diverse settings. In these simulations, the emergent interactions among agents also offer a novel perspective for examining the triggers and conditions that lead to war. Our findings offer data-driven and AI-augmented insights that can redefine how we approach conflict resolution and peacekeeping strategies. The implications stretch beyond historical analysis, offering a blueprint for using AI to understand human history and possibly prevent future international conflicts. Code and data are available at [this url](https://github.com/agiresearch/WarAgent). 

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Disjunction is used to connect multiple options when there is insufficient information to determine which one is true. However, free choice disjunction defies this simple fact -- when a disjunction acts as a free choice operator, all options are true. The usage of free choice disjunction is observed to usually co-occur with modals, pluralities, etc. This paper introduces a novel observation of sentences with free choice disjunction in English. Multiple data points are presented to demonstrate the semantic distribution. I propose that free choice reading in disjunctions depends on three factors --the sentence’s genericity, scope of the disjunction and disjuncts being imperfect nominals.

## Abstract
Disjunction is used to connect multiple options when there is insufficient information to determine which one is true. However, free choice disjunction defies this simple fact -- when a disjunction acts as a free choice operator, all options are true. The usage of free choice disjunction is observed to usually co-occur with modals, pluralities, etc. This paper introduces a novel observation of sentences with free choice disjunction in English. Multiple data points are presented to demonstrate the semantic distribution. I propose that free choice reading in disjunctions depends on three factors --the sentence’s genericity, scope of the disjunction and disjuncts being imperfect nominals.
