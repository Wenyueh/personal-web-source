# abstract: Can we avoid wars at the crossroads of history? This question has been pursued by individuals, scholars, policymakers, and organizations throughout human history. In this research, we attempt to answer the question based on the recent advances of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs). We propose \textbf{WarAgent}, an LLM-powered multi-agent AI system, to simulate the participating countries, their decisions, and the consequences, in historical international conflicts, including the World War I (WWI), the World War II (WWII), and the Warring States Period (WSP) in Ancient China. By evaluating the simulation effectiveness, we examine the advancements and limitations of cutting-edge AI systems' abilities in studying complex collective human behaviors such as international conflicts under diverse settings. In these simulations, the emergent interactions among agents also offer a novel perspective for examining the triggers and conditions that lead to war. Our findings offer data-driven and AI-augmented insights that can redefine how we approach conflict resolution and peacekeeping strategies. The implications stretch beyond historical analysis, offering a blueprint for using AI to understand human history and possibly prevent future international conflicts. Code and data are available at [this url](https://github.com/agiresearch/WarAgent). 

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This paper studies the learning of two functions given positive samples of their composition, motivated by an empirical problem in natural language phonology. Empirically relevant conditions under which this is possible are identified and a provably correct algorithm is given that can semi-strongly identify the two functions in polynomial time and data. In order to clearly illustrate the learning problem and related concepts, we focus on a simple subset of input strictly 2-local functions. But we further argue that the general learning procedure we propose can be extended to more general classes of functions.

## Abstract
This paper studies the learning of two functions given positive samples of their composition, motivated by an empirical problem in natural language phonology. Empirically relevant conditions under which this is possible are identified and a provably correct algorithm is given that can semi-strongly identify the two functions in polynomial time and data. In order to clearly illustrate the learning problem and related concepts, we focus on a simple subset of input strictly 2-local functions. But we further argue that the general learning procedure we propose can be extended to more general classes of functions.
