# abstract: Can we avoid wars at the crossroads of history? This question has been pursued by individuals, scholars, policymakers, and organizations throughout human history. In this research, we attempt to answer the question based on the recent advances of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs). We propose \textbf{WarAgent}, an LLM-powered multi-agent AI system, to simulate the participating countries, their decisions, and the consequences, in historical international conflicts, including the World War I (WWI), the World War II (WWII), and the Warring States Period (WSP) in Ancient China. By evaluating the simulation effectiveness, we examine the advancements and limitations of cutting-edge AI systems' abilities in studying complex collective human behaviors such as international conflicts under diverse settings. In these simulations, the emergent interactions among agents also offer a novel perspective for examining the triggers and conditions that lead to war. Our findings offer data-driven and AI-augmented insights that can redefine how we approach conflict resolution and peacekeeping strategies. The implications stretch beyond historical analysis, offering a blueprint for using AI to understand human history and possibly prevent future international conflicts. Code and data are available at [this url](https://github.com/agiresearch/WarAgent). 

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary:  Formal linguistics is a branch of linguistics that focuses on the study of language using formal methods derived from mathematics and logic. It aims to understand the underlying structure of language by constructing precise, well-defined models of its syntax, semantics, and phonology. The key aspects of formal linguistics include (1) Syntax -- This involves the study of the rules and principles that govern the structure of sentences. Formal syntactic theories explore how words combine to form grammatical sentences and the underlying rules that govern these combinations. (2) Semantics -- This aspect deals with the meaning of words, phrases, and sentences. Formal semantics seeks to represent and analyze the ways in which linguistic expressions can convey different meanings in different contexts. (3) Phonology -- This is the study of the sound systems of languages, including the rules for combining sounds into meaningful units or words. Formal phonology models the abstract sound structures of language and their functional roles.

## Abstract
Formal linguistics is a branch of linguistics that focuses on the study of language using formal methods derived from mathematics and logic. It aims to understand the underlying structure of language by constructing precise, well-defined models of its syntax, semantics, and phonology. The key aspects of formal linguistics include (1) Syntax -- This involves the study of the rules and principles that govern the structure of sentences. Formal syntactic theories explore how words combine to form grammatical sentences and the underlying rules that govern these combinations. (2) Semantics -- This aspect deals with the meaning of words, phrases, and sentences. Formal semantics seeks to represent and analyze the ways in which linguistic expressions can convey different meanings in different contexts. (3) Phonology -- This is the study of the sound systems of languages, including the rules for combining sounds into meaningful units or words. Formal phonology models the abstract sound structures of language and their functional roles.
